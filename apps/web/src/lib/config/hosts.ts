/**
 * Local-service hostname normalization.
 *
 * The compose stack (Postgres, MinIO, imgproxy) publishes its ports on the
 * DOCKER HOST. How you reach them therefore depends on where the process
 * runs, and one committed `.env` cannot be right for both:
 *   - on the host        → `localhost`
 *   - in a sibling container (an agent/phase runner) → `host.docker.internal`
 *
 * Getting this wrong is the classic local failure: `ENOTFOUND
 * host.docker.internal` from vitest/scripts on the host, or `ECONNREFUSED
 * localhost` from inside a container. So instead of asking everyone to edit
 * `.env`, tooling rewrites these variables at load time to whichever spelling
 * suits the current process.
 *
 * Pure and dependency-free on purpose (no node imports): the caller detects
 * containerhood and passes it in, which also makes both directions testable.
